The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) can be explained simply as follows:

If you have a parent class and a child class,
you should be able to use the child class wherever the parent class is expected without breaking the program.

In other words, the child class should behave in a way that doesnâ€™t surprise or cause errors
 when used in place of its parent class.

 In simpler terms when we use or call a function it should give an correct output instead of checking for errors!!
 ex- not all birds can able to fly ,so that we included the comman characteristic in Bird class and flying characteristic
     in a seperate class.

 so that only the flying bird inherit those classes and no error will occur!!

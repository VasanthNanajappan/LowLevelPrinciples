Definition:
    A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

Explanation:
     Each class should focus on a single task or functionality.
     This reduces the impact of changes and makes the code easier to maintain.
     For example, a class that handles user authentication should not also handle logging or sending emails.
